# Solidity Challenge

This project implements two Solidity-based smart contracts, as shown below:

1. NEWToken Contract

2. Contribution Contract


These smart contracts were coupled with a unit test for each contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
